User: you can respond
WymC:  Here's an example of a simple Python script that calculates the factorial of a given number. This script takes an integer as input and returns the factorial of the provided number, which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number.

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
result = factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is {result}")
```

You can run this script in any Python environment, such as an online Python interpreter or your local machine with a Python installation. Save the code above as `factorial.py`, and you can execute it using the command line (assuming you have Python installed):

```bash
python factorial.py
```
